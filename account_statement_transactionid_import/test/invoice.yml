  I create a new invoice with transaction ID
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: invoice_with_transaction_id}:
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    partner_id: base.res_partner_2
    transaction_id: XXX77Z
    invoice_line_ids:
      - name: '[PCSC234] PC Assemble SC234'
        price_unit: 450.0
        quantity: 1.0
        product_id: product.product_product_3
        uom_id: product.product_uom_unit
    journal_id: account.bank_journal
    reference_type: none
-
  I confirm the Invoice
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: invoice_with_transaction_id}
-
  I check that the invoice state is "Open"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: invoice_with_transaction_id}:
    - state == 'open'
