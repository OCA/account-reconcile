Prepare analytic plans before reconciliation
============================================

This module supports a workflow for bank statements where one person with few
permissions already assigns accounts and analytic plans to bank
transactions, so that another person only needs to review the assignment,
select the correct moves (filtered by the assigned partner and plan), and
then confirm the reconciliation.

Those preassigned plans are also used as default values for newly created
move lines during reconciliation.

Usage
=====

Select analytic plans on the bank statement form, and offered moves for
reconciliation will be filtered accordingly.
