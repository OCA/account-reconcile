This module extends the reconciliation feature of Odoo in order to change
the blue lines appearance conditions in the reconciliation propositions.

When opening the reconciliation widget, Odoo can propose account move lines
linked to an account that is not marked to "Allow Reconciliation", if said
account is defined as "Default Debit Account" or "Default Credit Account" on
the journal from the bank statement line.

This module restricts those proposition to move lines linked to an account
that is marked as "Allow Reconciliation".
