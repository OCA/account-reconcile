This module allows a workflow where you don't invoice sale orders until
you've received a payment.

That's useful ie for webshops with non-instant payment like wire
transfer, where you might have a lot of customers not doing the payment
after all, which results in extra work for cancellation of the
invoices/orders involved.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to Invoicing/Configuration/Reconciliation Models
2. Create a model of type *Rule to match sale orders*

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Have a payment on a bank statement matching the amount of an
   *invoicable* sale order
2. Enter the reconciliation screen
3. Observe that the sale order is offered as reconciliation counterpart

Note the reconciliation only works if fully invoicing the sale order
yields an invoice over the order's total amount. Usually this means that
all products in the sale order must have invoicing policy *Ordered
quantities*.
