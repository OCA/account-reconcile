To use this module, you need to:

1. Have a payment on a bank statement matching the amount of an *invoicable* sale order
2. Enter the reconciliation screen
3. Observe that the sale order is offered as reconciliation counterpart

Note the reconciliation only works if fully invoicing the sale order yields an invoice over the order's total amount. Usually this means that all products in the sale order must have invoicing policy *Ordered quantities*.
