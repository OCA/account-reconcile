 'description': """
 Adds transaction id to invoice and sale models and views.
 On Sales order, you can specify the transaction ID used
 for the payment and it will be propagated to the invoice
 (even if made from packing).
 This is mostly used for e-commerce handling.
 You can then add a mapping on that SO field to save
 the e-commerce financial Transaction ID into the
 OpenERP sale order field.
 The main purpose is to ease the reconciliation process and
 be able to find the partner when importing the bank statement.
