 'description': """
 This module brings basic methods and fields on bank statement to deal with
 the importation of different bank and offices. A generic abstract method is
 defined and an example that gives you a basic way of importing bank statement
 through a standard file is provided.

 This module improves the bank statement and allows you to import your bank
 transactions with a standard .csv or .xls file (you'll find it in the 'data'
 folder). It respects the profile (provided by the accouhnt_statement_ext
 module) to pass the entries. That means, you'll have to choose a file format
 for each profile.
 In order to achieve this it uses the `xlrd` Python module which you will need
 to install separately in your environment.

 This module can handle a commission taken by the payment office and has the
 following format:

 * __ref__: the SO number, INV number or any matching ref found. It'll be used
   as reference in the generated entries and will be useful for reconciliation
   process
 * __date__: date of the payment
 * __amount__: amount paid in the currency of the journal used in the
   importation profile
 * __label__: the comunication given by the payment office, used as
   communication in the generated entries.

 The goal is here to populate the statement lines of a bank statement with the
 infos that the bank or office give you. Fell free to inherit from this module
 to add your own format. Then, if you need to complete data from there, add your
 own account_statement_*_completion module and implement the needed rules.
