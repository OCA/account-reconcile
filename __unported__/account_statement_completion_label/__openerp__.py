    Improve the basic rule "Match from statement line label (based on partner
    field 'Bank Statement Label')" provided by the Bank statement base
    completion module. The goal is to match the label field from the bank
    statement line with a partner and an account.
    For this, you have to create your record in the new class
    account.statement.label where you can link the label you want with a
    partner and an account.
