  Add a completion method based on transaction ID providen by the bank/office.

  This transaction ID has been recorded on the SO (by a mapping
  through the e-commerce connector, or manually). Completion will look
  in the SO with that transaction ID to match the partner, then it
  will fill in the bank statement line with it,  as well as
  the reference with the found SO name to ease the reconciliation.

  This way, the reconciliation always happen on the SO name stored in ref.
