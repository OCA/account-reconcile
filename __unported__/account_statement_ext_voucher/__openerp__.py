 This module is deprecated. It was only needed when using
 account_bank_statement_ext with voucher in order to compute the period
 correctly. This is mainly because with account_bank_statement_ext, the period

 dependencies on account_voucher (mainly cause we can't get rid of the voucher
 in version 7.0).
