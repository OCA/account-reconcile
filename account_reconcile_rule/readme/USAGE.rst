When you use the *Reconcile* button of a bank statement, Odoo
automatically proposes you matching journal entries for each statement
line.  This module automatically adds journal entries generated from the
*Reconciliation Models* if a rule matches with the current
situation, so there is nothing special to do once the rules are
configured.
