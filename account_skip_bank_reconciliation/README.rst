This module allows to exclude from bank statement reconciliation
all journal items of a specific reconcilable account. It also allows
to specify in the Bank Journal which accounts should be taken into account
for reconciliation.

Usually, you would want to that in accounts like the
`Goods Received Not Invoiced`, which are required to be reconcilable
to be able to have proper traceability in stock received but
their reconciliation is done using the `account_mass_reconcile` module.

=====

1. Go to  `Invoicing / Configuration / Accounting / Charts of Accounts`
   and open a reconcilable account.
2. In that account, select or not the `Exclude from Bank Reconciliation` option.

or

1. Go to  `Invoicing / Configuration / Accounting / Journals` and open any
   bank Journal
2. In the Journal select the accounts that you would like to be proposed in
   reconciliations.

Be careful, if an account is set to be excluded it will be excluded even if it
appears in the Bank Journal to be considered for reconciliation.
