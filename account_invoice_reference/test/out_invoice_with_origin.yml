  In order to check if the reference of the move is the origin of
  the invoice (customer invoices), I create an invoice
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: invoice_reference_origin}:
    payment_term: account.account_payment_term_advance
    journal_id: account.sales_journal
    partner_id: base.res_partner_3
    reference_type: none
    name: 'Test Customer Invoice'
    origin: ABC123
    invoice_line:
      - product_id: product.product_product_5
        quantity: 10.0
-
  I create invoice by clicking on Create button
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: invoice_reference_origin}
-
  I check that the reference of the move is the origin of the invoice
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: invoice_reference_origin}:
    - move_id.ref == 'ABC123'
