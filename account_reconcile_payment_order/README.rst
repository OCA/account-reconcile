Payment orders that show up as one big transaction can be difficult for the
accounting to handle if a transfer account is used. In this case, we need to
reconcile this transaction with possibly hundreds of move lines, which can be a
bit tiresome. This module tries to recognize transactions deriving from payment
orders and propose the unreconciled move lines from this payment order.

Installation
============

This module requires the module **account_payment_order**, available
in https://github.com/OCA/bank-payment.

Configuration
=============

#. Go to *Settings > Users & Companies > Users*.
#. Give to your user the permission "Show Full Accounting Features".

Usage
=====

#. Go to *Invoicing > Overview*.
#. Locate the bank kanban card and import or create a new statement on it.
#. When reconciling, it should just work. What the module does is to search for
   a finished payment order that has the same amount as the statement line. If
   any, generated move lines (bank or AR/AP ones) are automatically proposed
   for the reconciliation.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* It would be good to check references too, but bank usually change some
  characters, so this doesn't seem to be a general solution.
* Take into account different currencies (in payment order or in bank
  statement).
* Try to match payment orders resulting entries grouped by due date, instead of
  a whole, but this will affect performance for sure.
* When the reconcile models end with more inheritable code, implement this
  as a new type of reconciliation in this model.
* Develop real UI tests, instead of mimicking the call to the involved method.
