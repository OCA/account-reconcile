Payment orders that show up as one big transaction can be difficult for the
accounting to handle if a transfer account is used. In this case, we need to
reconcile this transaction with possibly hundreds of move lines, which can be a
bit tiresome. This module tries to recognize transactions deriving from payment
orders and propose the unreconciled move lines from this payment order.
