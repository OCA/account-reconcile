  I check that my invoice is a supplier invoice
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account.demo_invoice_0, string: Check invoice type}:
    - type == 'in_invoice'
-
  I add a reference to an existing supplier invoce
-
  !python {model: account.invoice}: |
    self.write(cr, uid, ref('account.demo_invoice_0'), {
      'supplier_invoice_number': 'T2S12345'
    })
-
  I check a second time that my invoice is still a supplier invoice
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account.demo_invoice_0, string: Check invoice type 2}:
    - type == 'in_invoice'
-
  Now I confirm it
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: account.demo_invoice_0}
-
  I check that the supplier number is there
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account.demo_invoice_0, string: Check supplier number}:
    - supplier_invoice_number == 'T2S12345'
-
  I check a third time that my invoice is still a supplier invoice
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: account.demo_invoice_0, string: Check invoice type 3}:
    - type == 'in_invoice'
