  In order to test the banking framework, I first need to create a profile
-
  !record {model: account.statement.profile, id: profile_test1}:
    name: Bank EUR Profile
    journal_id: account.bank_journal
    commission_account_id: account.a_expense
    company_id: base.main_company
    balance_check: True
    rule_ids:
      - bank_statement_completion_rule_4
      - bank_statement_completion_rule_5
      - bank_statement_completion_rule_2
      - bank_statement_completion_rule_3
-
  Now I create a statement. I create statment lines separately because I need
  to find each one by XML id
-
  !record {model: account.bank.statement, id: statement_test1}:
    name: Statement 2
    profile_id: profile_test1
    company_id: base.main_company
-
  I create a statement line for a CI
-
  !record {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_ci}:
    name: Test autocompletion based on Customer Invoice Number
    statement_id: statement_test1
    ref: CI0001
    date: '2013-12-20'
    amount: 210.0
-
  I create a statement line for a SI
-
  !record {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_si}:
    name: Test autocompletion based on Supplier Invoice Number
    statement_id: statement_test1
    ref: T2S12345
    date: '2013-12-19'
    amount: -65.0
-
  I create a statement line for a CR
-
  !record {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_cr}:
    name: Test autocompletion based on Customer Refund Number
    statement_id: statement_test1
    ref: CR0001
    date: '2013-12-19'
    amount: -210.0
-
  I create a statement line for the Partner Name
-
  !record {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_partner_name}:
    name: Test autocompletion based on Partner Name Vauxoo
    statement_id: statement_test1
    ref: /
    date: '2013-12-17'
    amount: 600.0
-
  I create a statement line for the Partner Label
-
  !record {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_partner_label}:
    name: test autocompletion based on text (XXX66Z) matching with partner form information (note that Ref does not exist)
    statement_id: statement_test1
    ref: ZU788
    date: '2013-12-24'
    amount: -932.4
-
  I run the auto complete
-
  !python {model: account.bank.statement}: |
    result = self.button_auto_completion(cr, uid, [ref("statement_test1")])
-
  Now I can check that all is nice and shiny, line 1. I expect the Customer
  Invoice Number to be recognised.
  I Use _ref, because ref conflicts with the field ref of the statement line
-
  !assert {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_ci, string: Check completion by CI number}:
    - partner_id.id == _ref("base.res_partner_12")
-
  Line 2. I expect the Supplier invoice number to be recognised. The supplier
  invoice was created by the account module demo data, and we confirmed it
  here.
-
  !assert {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_si, string: Check completion by SI number}:
    - partner_id.id == _ref("base.res_partner_17")
-
  Line 3. I expect the Customer refund number to be recognised. It should be
  the commercial partner, and not the regular partner.
-
  !assert {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_cr, string: Check completion by CR number and commercial partner}:
    - partner_id.id == _ref("base.res_partner_12")
-
  Line 4. I check that the partner name has been recognised.
-
  !assert {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_partner_name, string: Check completion by partner name}:
    - partner_id.name == 'Vauxoo'
-
  Line 5. I check that the partner special label has been recognised.
-
  !assert {model: account.bank.statement.line, id: statement_line_partner_label, string: Check completion by partner label}:
    - partner_id.id == _ref("base.res_partner_6")
