  I create a customer Invoice to be found by the completion.
-
  !record {model: account.invoice, id: invoice_for_completion_1}:
    account_id: account.a_recv
    company_id: base.main_company
    currency_id: base.EUR
    internal_number: CI0001
    invoice_line:
      - account_id: account.a_sale
        name: '[PCSC234] PC Assemble SC234'
        price_unit: 210.0
        quantity: 1.0
        product_id: product.product_product_3
        uos_id: product.product_uom_unit
    journal_id: account.bank_journal
    partner_id: base.res_partner_12
    reference_type: none
-
  I confirm the Invoice
-
  !workflow {model: account.invoice, action: invoice_open, ref: invoice_for_completion_1}
-
  I check that the invoice state is "Open"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: invoice_for_completion_1}:
    - state == 'open'
-
  I check that it is given the number "CI0001"
-
  !assert {model: account.invoice, id: invoice_for_completion_1, string: Check CI number}:
    - number == 'CI0001'
