==================
Advanced Reconcile
==================

Advanced reconciliation methods for the module account_easy_reconcile.

In addition to the features implemented in account_easy_reconcile, which are:
 - Reconciliation facilities for big volume of transactions.
 - Setup different profiles of reconciliation by account.
 - Each profile can use many methods of reconciliation.
 - Base to create others reconciliation methods which can plug in the profiles.
 - A profile a reconciliation can be run manually or by a cron.
 - Monitoring of reconciliation runs with a history.

, this module implements a basis to create advanced reconciliation methods
in a few lines of code.

Typically, such methods can be:
 - Reconcile Journal items if the partner and the ref are equal.
 - Reconcile Journal items if the partner is equal and the ref
   is the same than ref or name.
 - Reconcile Journal items if the partner is equal and the ref
   match with a pattern.

And they allow:
 - Reconciliations with multiple credit / multiple debit lines.
 - Partial reconciliations.
 - Write-off amount as well.

A method is already implemented in this module, it matches on items:
 - Partner.
 - Ref on credit move lines should be case insensitive equals to the ref or
   the name of the debit move line.

The base class to find the reconciliations is built to be as efficient as
possible.

So basically, if you have an invoice with 3 payments (one per month), the first
month, it will partial reconcile the debit move line with the first payment,
the second month, it will partial reconcile the debit move line with 2 first
payments, the third month, it will make the full reconciliation.

This module is perfectly adapted for E-Commerce business where a big volume of
move lines and so, reconciliations, are involved and payments often come from
many offices.
