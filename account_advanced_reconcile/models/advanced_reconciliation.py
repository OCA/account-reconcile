        All the matcher keys in the dict must have their equivalent in

        The values of each matcher key will be searched in the
        one returned by the `_opposite_matchers`

        Must be inherited to implement the matchers for one method

        For instance, it can return:

        The matchers will be evaluated in the same order as declared
        vs the the opposite matchers, so you can gain performance by
        declaring first the partners with the less computation.

        All matchers should match with their opposite to be considered
        as "matching".

        equals on the opposite line matchers.

        Must be inherited to implement the matchers for one method
        It can be inherited to apply some formatting of fields
        (strip(), lower() and so on)

        This method is the counterpart of the `_matchers()` method.

        Each matcher has to yield its value respecting the order
        of the `_matchers()`.

        When a matcher does not correspond, the next matchers won't
        be evaluated so the ones which need the less computation
        have to be executed first.

        If the `_matchers()` returns:
        (('partner_id', move_line['partner_id']),
         ('ref', move_line['ref']))

        Here, you should yield :
        yield ('partner_id', move_line['partner_id'])
        yield ('ref', move_line['ref'])

        Note that a matcher can contain multiple values, as instance,
        if for a move line, you want to search from its `ref` in the
        `ref` or `name` fields of the opposite move lines, you have to
        yield ('partner_id', move_line['partner_id'])
        yield ('ref', (move_line['ref'], move_line['name'])

        An OR is used between the values for the same key.
        An AND is used between the differents keys.
