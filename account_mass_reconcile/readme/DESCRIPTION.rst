This is a shared work between Akretion and Camptocamp
in order to provide:

- Reconciliation facilities for big volume of transactions.
- Setup different profiles of reconciliation by account.
- Each profile can use many methods of reconciliation.
- This module is also a base to create others
  reconciliation methods which can plug in the profiles.
- A profile a reconciliation can be run manually
  or by a cron.
- Monitoring of reconciliation runs with an history
  which keep track of the reconciled Journal items.

2 simple reconciliation methods are integrated
in this module, the simple reconciliations works
on 2 lines (1 debit / 1 credit) and do not allow
partial reconciliation, they also match on 1 key,
partner or Journal item name.
