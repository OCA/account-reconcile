==============
Mass Reconcile
==============

This is a shared work between Akretion and Camptocamp
in order to provide:
- reconciliation facilities for big volume of transactions
- setup different profiles of reconciliation by account
- each profile can use many methods of reconciliation
- this module is also a base to create others
reconciliation methods which can plug in the profiles
- a profile a reconciliation can be run manually
or by a cron
- monitoring of reconciliation runs with an history
which keep track of the reconciled Journal items

2 simple reconciliation methods are integrated
in this module, the simple reconciliations works
on 2 lines (1 debit / 1 credit) and do not allow
partial reconcilation, they also match on 1 key,
partner or Journal item name.

This module combines both the ``account_easy_reconcile``
and the``account_advanced_reconcile`` modules
from previous versions.

Usage
=====

Go to 'Invoicing/Periodic Processing/Reconciliation/Mass Automatic Reconcile' to start a
new mass reconcile.
